         In 1897, J. J. Thompson proposed that atoms could be broken down into smaller components. <br/><br/>
         Thompson had been studying cathode rays generated in a Crooks tube.  He theorized that the cathode ray was composed of tiny particles
            (he evenutally discovered that these particles were 1,000 times smaller than an atom) that had a very high charge to mass ratio.
            He named these particles 'corpuscles'.  However, later researchers realized that, six years earlier, George Johnstone Stoney
            had theorized that fundamental unit quantities of electricity exist, and had named them 'electrons'.
