            In 1904, Thompson developed his model of the atom.<br/><br/>
            He believed that these 'corpuscles' were normally embedded in the atom, and distributed in ordered locations.
            To keep the overall charge of the atom neutral, he assumed that the corpuscles were rotating in a larger volume of positive charge. <br/><br/>
            This model was called the 'Plum Pudding' model.
