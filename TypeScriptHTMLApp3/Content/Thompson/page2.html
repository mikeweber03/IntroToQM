            In 1904, Thompson developed his model of the atom.<br/><br/>
            He believed that these 'corpuscles' were normally embedded in the atom, and distributed in electrostatic locations.
            To keep the overall charge of the atom neutral, he assumed that the corpuscles were embedded in a large sea of positive charge. <br/><br/>
            This model was called the 'Plum Pudding' model.
