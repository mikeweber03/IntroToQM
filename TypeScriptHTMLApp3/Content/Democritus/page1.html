            `Let's start this chapter with a thought puzzle.
            Ancient Greeks did not have the concept of experimental science.
            All of their scientific inquiry relied on 'thought puzzles'.
            <br /><br />Democritus was an ancient Greek philosopher who lived around 350 BC, and speculated on what the smallest
            piece of a material (in this case a gold bar) could possibly be cut.
