        In 1908, Ernest Rutherford began a series of experiments where thin foils of a variety of metals were bombarded 
            with alpha particles.  Most of these particles passed through the foil unimpeded; however, Rutherford was interested 
            in measuring the deflection of these particles.<br/><br/>
